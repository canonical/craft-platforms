Utilities for handling platform information for Snapcraft, Charmcraft, Rockcraft, and
other craft tools based on [Craft Application](https://canonical-craft-application.readthedocs-hosted.com).

Craft Platforms parses information defined in a craft recipe file such as a
`snapcraft.yaml` file and creates a build plan. A build plan describes the
environments where the application can build artifacts and the environments
where the artifacts can run.

## Basic usage

Craft Platforms creates exhaustive build plans for any craft-like data structure,
taking into account differences per application.

```terminal
>>> import craft_platforms
>>> craft_platforms.get_build_plan(
...     "mycraft",
...     project_data={"base": "debian@14", "platforms": {"riscv64": None}}
... )
[BuildInfo(platform='riscv64', build_on='riscv64', build_for='riscv64', build_base=DistroBase(distribution='debian', series='14'))]
```
