**Craft Platforms** is a library that handles platform information for Snapcraft,
Charmcraft, Rockcraft, and other craft apps. A platform in this sense is the combination
of an operating system version and its target architecture.

The library's primary function is to parse information in a craft project file, such as
`snapcraft.yaml`, and creates a build plan from it. The plan is a manifest for
environments, describing those where the artifact can build and run.

This library is most useful for developers who build apps with the [Craft
Application](https://canonical-craft-application.readthedocs-hosted.com) library.

## Basic usage

Craft Platforms creates exhaustive build plans for any craft-like data structure,
taking into account differences between applications.

```terminal
>>> import craft_platforms
>>> craft_platforms.get_build_plan(
...     "mycraft",
...     project_data={"base": "debian@14", "platforms": {"riscv64": None}}
... )
[BuildInfo(platform='riscv64', build_on='riscv64', build_for='riscv64', build_base=DistroBase(distribution='debian', series='14'))]
```
