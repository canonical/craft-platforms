Review the wording carefully and only copy it if the support offered makes sense. If it
seems wrong, speak with Canonical Security Engineering about refining a version for
your application.

Canonical tracks and responds to vulnerabilities in:

- The most recent patch version of Craft Platforms.
- Any version of Craft Platforms that's included in a current release of a Canonical
  product.
=======
Only the latest minor version of major versions supported in an Ubuntu LTS release
receive security support. Backports to previous minor releases or other unsupported
releases are made on a best-effort basis and will typically only be done for critical
vulnerabilities.

This support tracks the Ubuntu LTS release cycle. The most recent major version will
always support Ubuntu LTS series still in their regular maintenance lifecycle. When a
major Starcraft release drops support for an Ubuntu LTS series, the previous major
release remains supported for only the dropped LTS series until the end of its extended
support lifecycle.

Once an LTS release of Ubuntu is sunset, new security fixes for this software will no
longer be provided.
